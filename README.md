# org.example.d4p.pdf2-multipass
Example of a multipass PDF generation process that extends the base PDF2 plugin. Currently handles floated content that is longer than a page, content that is to be rotated (i.e., landscape orientation on a portrait-oriented page), and the setting of drop folios. Presently only works with AntennaHouse 6.x.
